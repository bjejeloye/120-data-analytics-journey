## Day 5 of My 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today I learned about **time series analysis** — its components like **trend**, **seasonality**, and patterns over time — and how it’s applied in real situations. It helped me see how numbers change across months or years and how those changes can guide decisions.

What stood out to me is how much math is quietly working behind the scenes to solve everyday problems, from forecasting sales to planning resources.

As a beginner, I’m still adjusting to thinking about data as something that moves over time, not just something static in a table.

**When did time-based analysis start to make sense for you?**
