Day 8 of my 120-day data analytics challenge.

Today I went back to the basics and spent time learning Excel. I practiced entering data properly, formatting it so it’s clean and readable, and copying or moving data from one sheet to another using formulas like referencing ranges.

It sounds simple, but I realized how important these small steps are before any real analysis even begins. 

What made today interesting was noticing how much I didn’t know about something I thought was “basic.” Watching the video and trying it myself showed me there’s always something new to pick up.

I’m starting to respect the fundamentals more.

Did you ever go back to the basics and realize you had been skipping important details?
