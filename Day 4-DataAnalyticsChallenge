## Day 4 of My 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today, I learned about hypothesis testing and regression.

Hypothesis testing stood out to me because it’s about checking whether a claim actually holds up when you look at the data. It made me realize that decisions shouldn’t just rely on assumptions, even if they sound reasonable.

I also learned how regression can be used to predict outcomes, understand relationships between variables, and identify what really drives results. That part felt powerful, but also a bit heavy as a beginner.

I’m starting to see how much responsibility comes with interpreting data correctly. For those further ahead, what helped you build confidence in applying these concepts?
