## Day 11 of My 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today I worked on charts — line, bar, and pie charts first, then more advanced ones like map charts, statistical charts, and sparklines.

At a basic level, charts seem simple: select data, insert chart, done. But I started noticing how easy it is to misrepresent something just by choosing the wrong type. A pie chart can hide small differences. A line chart can suggest a trend that isn’t really strong. Even colors change how something feels.

Map charts were interesting because they add context instantly, but they also depend heavily on clean, consistent data. Sparklines felt subtle — small, almost quiet visuals — but surprisingly useful for spotting patterns quickly.

I’m still very much a beginner, but I’m starting to see that visualization isn’t just decoration. It’s interpretation.

At what point did you start feeling confident choosing the “right” chart instead of just picking one?
