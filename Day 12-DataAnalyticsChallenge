Today I learned how to convert raw cells into a proper table, work more intentionally with cell formatting, use conditional formatting, and explore collaboration features.

Converting data into a table seems small, but it changed how everything behaves — sorting, filtering, and formulas just made more sense. It felt less like random cells and more like structured data.

Conditional formatting was interesting too. Seeing patterns highlighted automatically made the data easier to read without me doing extra analysis. It made me realize how presentation affects understanding.

Collaboration was a reminder that spreadsheets aren’t just personal tools. Other people can jump in, edit, comment, and change things in real time. That part feels both powerful and slightly intimidating as a beginner.

Still early in this journey, but I’m starting to see how small features connect to bigger workflows.

**What’s one “simple” feature that changed how you work with data?**
