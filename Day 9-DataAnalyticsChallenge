## Day 9 of My 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today I spent time understanding the difference between **formulas** and **functions**.

At first, they sounded almost the same to me. But as I practiced, I started to see that **formulas are what you build**, while **functions are predefined tools you can use inside them**. That small distinction made things much clearer.

It also reminded me that learning data analytics isn’t just about big concepts. Sometimes it’s about slowing down and really understanding the small building blocks.

I’m still getting comfortable writing them without second-guessing myself.  

When did formulas start to feel natural for you?
