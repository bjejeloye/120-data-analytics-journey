Day 2 of my 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today I learned about measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (range, standard deviation, interquartile range).

What clicked for me was realizing that averages alone don’t tell the full story — spread shows how consistent or scattered the data really is. 

The interquartile range was a bit confusing at first, but breaking it down step by step helped it make more sense. 

It’s starting to feel less like formulas and more like ways to describe real situations with data.

It’s still early days, but I’m beginning to see how data tells clearer, more meaningful stories when you look beyond just one number.
