## Day 3 of My 120-Day Data Analytics Challenge

Today’s focus was on probability distributions and how they help describe what typically happens in real situations rather than what might happen by chance. What stood out to me is that data doesn’t just look backward — it can also help us reason about the future in a more grounded way.

What challenged me was moving from seeing probability as just math to seeing it as a practical tool for decision-making.

I’m still getting comfortable with this way of thinking. 

Did probability feel this abstract when you first encountered it?
